# Sudo-bot
Something to test and track my current bot

Not much here, but thus far does these things:

## Ping
> ### \/ping (slient)
> Does a ping with the server for ping and API latency

## User
> ### \/user \<target\> (slient)
> Get info about a user

## Timestamp
> ### \/timestamp \<date\> \<time\> \<region\> (format) (slient)
> Generate a timestamp code to use!

> #### Includes auto correcting within your messages for others!
> ##### This format includes: (day) at/@ 24-time
> this inclues things like: "mon at 1300", "Thurs @ 100", "today at 2100", "tomorrow @ 1700"
> #### Now supporting auto timestamp converstions!
> start with `/settimestamp \<region\>`, and then when the message is picked up by the mentioned methods above, it will auto translate!

## Ping
> ### \/say \<message\>
> make the bot say somthing without mentioning yourself!
