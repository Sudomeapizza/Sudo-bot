# Sudo-bot
Something to test and track my current bot

Not much here, but thus far does these things:

## Ping
> ### \/ping (slient)

> Does a ping with the server for ping and API latency

## User
> ### \/user \<target\> (slient)

> Get info about a user

## Timestamp
> ### \/timestamp \<date\> \<time\> \<region\> (format) (slient)

> Generate a timestamp code to use!

## Ping
> ### \/say \<message\>

> make the bot say somthing without mentioning yourself!
